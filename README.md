"# Draco" 

Generic 2D RPG I was making that borrows most of its UI from Skyrim. I haven't really done anything with this in about a year but plan on doing so once I've finally had enough of Game Maker 3D. Right now it's just on Github so I can use it as a ginuea pig for a GMS2 version of GMOF or something.
